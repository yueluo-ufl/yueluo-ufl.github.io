Fall accidents lead to hospitalization and medical costs among all age groups, especially severe for older adults. Both intrinsic (e.g., visual impairment, fear of falling) and extrinsic (e.g., inappropriate carpet design, poor lighting) factors contribute to fall accidents. Older adults increasingly rely on visual perception to maintain balance as their health conditions decline. Patterned carpet is common in the built environment, which is one of the factors contributing to fall accidents among older adults. This study examined the role of path-based visual cues (provide visual guidance while walking along the patterned carpet) in helping older adults maintain safe movement and overcome the fear of falling. The experimental field study was conducted at a Continuing Care Retirement Community. Thirty-two residents were recruited. Within-subjects design was employed to examine the effects of path-based visual cues (light color and brightness) on the gait characteristics of older adults with and without visual impairment while walking on patterned carpet. Wearable sensors collected older adults' gait characteristics and questionnaires were used to evaluate their perceptions of confidence and safety with different visual cues provided. Individual repeated measures analysis results indicated that older adults significantly decreased stride length and stride velocity under 8.3 fc white and 7.3 fc blue lighting conditions compared to the baseline condition. In addition, the principal component analysis also indicated significant differences in gait performance among lighting colors and lighting brightness. The subjective responses indicated that the path-based visual cues were helpful in improving walking confidence, particularly for older adults with visual impairment.

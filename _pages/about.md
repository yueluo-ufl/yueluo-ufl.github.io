I intend to receive my Ph.D. degree in April, 2023. I also earned my Master's degrees in[Industrial and Operations Engineering](https://ioe.engin.umich.edu) and [Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.umich.edu) at [the University of Michigan](https://umich.edu) on 2019 and 2017, respectively. My research interests are on human factors and ergonomics, particularly on fall prevention for the aging population through innovative interior design interventions.

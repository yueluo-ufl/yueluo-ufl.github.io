Personal and environmental factors both increase the likelihood of falling injuries while negotiating obstacles. Eighteen male participants (seven older, eleven young) were recruited to walk over an obstacle with and without loads on their hands to study the effects of age, load carriage modes, and limb crossing patterns on gait during obstacle negotiation. Participants initiated tasks with either their dominant or non-dominant leg. Step length (SL), toe clearance (TC), step velocity (V), and step width (SW) were extracted from four critical steps. Results showed that during obstacle negotiation (1) older adults had more TC than younger adults, (2) hand loads affected SL and TC, (3) gait parameters are dissimilar between the dominant limb and non-dominant limb.

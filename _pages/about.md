About me
======
I am a Ph.D. student in [the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.ise.ufl.edu) at [the University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu). I am on schedule to defend and deposit my dissertation in December 2022. Before joining in UFL, I also earned my Master's degrees in[Industrial and Operations Engineering](https://ioe.engin.umich.edu) and [Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.umich.edu) at [the University of Michigan](https://umich.edu) on 2019 and 2017, respectively. 

The goal of my research is to prevent falls and fall-induced injuries as well as improve human performance and well-being in the contexts of occupational and domestic-living environments, with a special focus on vulnerable or disadvantaged populations (e.g., older adults or people with physical impairments). My research mainly uses data analytics, wearable technology, digital human modeling, and systems safety to quantify changes in human behavior caused by exterior factors (e.g., assistive devices, environmental interventions, & occupational activities).

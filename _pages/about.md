About me
======
I am a Ph.D. Candidate from [the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.ise.ufl.edu) at [the University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu) who is interested in human factors and system safety engineering. Before joining the UFL, I have also received my Master's degrees in [Industrial and Operations Engineering](https://ioe.engin.umich.edu) and [Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.umich.edu) at [the University of Michigan](https://umich.edu) on 2019 and 2017, respectively. 

My research interests are centered on the effective collaboration between humans and embodied technology (e.g., robots, virtual reality, wearable systems, etc.). The goal of my research is to ensure a seamless interaction when humans collaborating with fellow humans and other entities (e.g., collaborative robots). By monitoring human capabilities using biomechanics approaches, human behavior can be quantified, with potential contributing factors leading to injuries from the hybrid societies (humans + other agents) identified and prevented.

My research values diversity and living independence, with a special focus on injury prevention and mobility improvement among the vulnerable populations (e.g., older adults and/or people with physical impairments). By employing knowledges in data analytics, wearable technology, digital human modeling, and systems safety, effective interventions can be realized in both of the occupational and domestic-living environments to benefit humans to better interact with everchanging exterior components from the environment.

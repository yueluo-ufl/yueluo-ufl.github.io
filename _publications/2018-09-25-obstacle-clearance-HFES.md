This study investigated the effect of obstacles of different heights on task performance and compensatory movements of six individuals with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30kg/m2. Obstacle heights were increased from 36cm to 66cm in 5cm increments using a method of limits. Video- based task analysis was used to develop a conceptual model of obstacle clearance and compensatory movements in response to the postural challenge of increasing obstacle heights. Results from the task analysis were used to identify temporal and kinematic performance measures of dynamic balance and postural control. Changes in obstacle clearance performance and compensatory movements may indicate heightened fall risk and could be mitigated by accessible design and assistive support features in the environment.

The ubiquity of smartphones has increased the engagement of phone use during street walking. Unfortunately, the risks of accidents and injuries caused by phone distracted walking are often overlooked. Several laboratory studies have shown that texting while walking can alter cognitive (e.g. reduced situation awareness and physical (e.g. reduced walking speed) performance. However, the relationship between cognitive demands and the corresponding gait and posture adaptation is yet to be explored. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to investigate gait and posture responses caused by common smartphone usage of different cognitive loads during outdoor walking. Results showed a difference in gait behaviors between normal and phone distracted walking. Posture responses to phone operation tasks in varied cognitive workload levels were also observed to be different. Results from this study can be used as evidence for pedestrians of the recommended level of phone engagement in dynamic and public environments.
